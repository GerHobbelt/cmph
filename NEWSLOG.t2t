----------------------------------------

==News for version 0.6==

- [An algorithm to generate MPHFs that require less than 4 bits per key to be stored fch.html], which is referred to as FCH algorithm. The algorithm is only efficient for small sets.
- The FCH algorithm is integrated with [BRZ algorithm brz.html] so that you will be able to efficiently generate space-efficient MPHFs for sets in the order of billion keys.
- All reported bugs and suggestions have been corrected and included as well.


----------------------------------------

==News for version 0.5==

- A thread safe vector adapter has been added.
- [A new algorithm for sets in the order of billion of keys that requires approximately 8.1 bits per key to store the resulting MPHFs. brz.html] 
- All reported bugs and suggestions have been corrected and included as well.


----------------------------------------

==News for version 0.4==

- Vector Adapter has been added.
- An optimized version of bmz (bmz8) for small set of keys (at most 256 keys) has been added.
- All reported bugs and suggestions have been corrected and included as well.


----------------------------------------

==News for version 0.3==

- New heuristic added to the bmz algorithm permits to generate a mphf with only
  //24.80n + O(1)// bytes. The resulting function can be stored in //3.72n// bytes.
