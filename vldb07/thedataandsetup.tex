\subsection{The data and the experimental setup}
\label{sec:data-exper-set}

The algorithms were implemented in the C language and
are available at \texttt{http://\-cmph.sf.net}
under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).
% free software licence.
All experiments were carried out on
a computer running the Linux operating system, version 2.6,
with a 2.4 gigahertz processor and
1 gigabyte of main memory. 
In the experiments related to the new
algorithm we limited the main memory in 500 megabytes.

Our data consists of a collection of 1 billion
URLs collected from the Web, each URL 64 characters long on average.
The collection is stored on disk in 60.5 gigabytes.
